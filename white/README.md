# surah-name-glyphs

A collection of all the names of chapters in the Holy Qur'an in SVG format.

This was created to help designers and developers who're working on Muslim apps that need to show names of Surahs.

The SVGs were all part of an SVG font. I had to use the IcoMoon app to convert the glyphs in the font to these files you're seeing here.

I hope it helps :).
